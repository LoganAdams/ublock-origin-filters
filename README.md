My uBlock Origin filters

## Twitter

Remove all distractions, feed, sidebar, etc. Most of the time I only want to:
- see the tweet feed in a specific profile I have opened;
- or, see a tweet content and it's comments.

I remove everything else. I might remove the notifications and the menu, if I find it distracts me.
